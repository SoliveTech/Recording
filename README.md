# Recording-of-diffusion-model-learning
My study of diffusion began in July 2023 and went through a series of "spiraling" awareness processes. 
Diffusion is not my main research area before, so I can only say that it is still learning. And I try to follow some relevant works now,so I restart to record the learning progress.

The biggest impression of diffusion in the early learning process includes two points: 1. The gap between mathematical theory and programming implementation is very large. 2. The blogs that come out of each diffusion search are too varied and are about different papers, and the relationships between these papers are not clear.
